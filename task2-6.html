    <h1>Check out my borders</h1>
    <p>We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.</p>
    <p>Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color; all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.</p>
    <p>Alternately, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class)</span>. That prevents it from messing with the line height.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Notice how the borders double up here:</h3>
  <div class="double red-border-div">This div has a red border</div>
  <div class="double blue-border-div">This div has a blue border</div>

  <h3>Notice how this fixes the borders:</h3>
  <div class="red-border-round-top">This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</div>
  <div class="blue-border-round-bottom">This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</div>
</body>
